# Curacao_Census2011
A procedure of collecting information about every member of the population of Curacao.

## Introduce you topic and you motivation for the project.

Hallo, this is Etienne Sambo with the Map673 class of Fall 2018,
In the Digital Mapping Program of the University of Kentucky.
Now I present to you my final mapping project for the Map673 class.
I have chosen the topic of the demographics of Curaçao using the Census data.
This was the first official census for the territory of Curaçao and was held, March of 2011.
This map provides some of the demographic data for the geo-zones of Curaçao.
My motivation for this project was to present this data to the people of Curaçao using open source technology. Previously, this data was presented in other proprietary software.
Given that, another census will be held in two years’ time, this solution may be an option to present the data off the next census.

## Briefly describe your target user and their goals and objectives for using the map.
This map target people all over the world and obviously the Curaçao people, especially those who want more detailed information of the data received from the census of 2011. 
The goal is that the users can consult the map whenever they want and compare the results with those of the Curaçao Statistical Office.

## Walk us through a live use case scenario using the map. Explain the various interface components and how the user will use them.

## Clossing
Now, this was my presentation.
I think it was very educational to show the real data into a map.
